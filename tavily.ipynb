The court emphasized that everyone must prioritize the public\\'s trust and that Chief Ministers cannot dictate their will regardless of public opinion. \\n\\nThe case involves the appointment of a controversial IFS officer as the Director of Rajaji Tiger Reserve by Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami. The appointment was opposed by the state\\'s Forest Minister, the Secretary and Joint Secretary of the Forest Department. Despite this opposition, Dhami allegedly used his authority to force the appointment.  \\n\\nThe Supreme Court questioned the Chief Minister\\'s strong preference for the officer, who was previously the Director of Jim Corbett Tiger Reserve and is currently under departmental investigation. The court also questioned the basis for this preference, considering the officer\\'s ongoing investigation.'"

       "\"The Supreme Court of India has criticized the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand, Pushkar Singh Dhami, for his appointment of a controversial IFS officer as the director of the Rajaji Tiger Reserve. The court stated that heads of governments cannot act like “old days’ kings” and that “we are not in a feudal era.”  The court questioned the Chief Minister's “special affection” for the officer, considering that disciplinary proceedings are pending against him.  \\n\\nThe court highlighted the concerns of various officers who argued against the officer's appointment, pointing out that there is a “public trust doctrine” in the country. The court also inquired about the reason for departmental proceedings against the officer, as such proceedings are initiated only when there is prima facie evidence. The appointment was subsequently withdrawn by the state government on September 3.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court's decision was driven by concerns that the Chief Minister disregarded the opinions of multiple officials, including the forest minister, who had recommended against the appointment. Despite the state government's withdrawal of the order, the court emphasized the importance of prioritizing public trust and ensuring that the actions of Chief Ministers are not dictated by personal preferences but rather by what is best for the public.\""
